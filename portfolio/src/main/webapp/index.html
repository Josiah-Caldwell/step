        <p><img src="/images/Mark.png" alt="Mark of the Outsider" id="Mark">My name is Josiah Caldwell, I am a computer science student at
           North Carolina A&T State University and this is my second year at Google. 
           I spent my last summer working with some wonderful people on the Gmail team in Sunnyvale, CA. 
           I learned a lot from Google last year and i hope to do the same moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>I first got into computer science because I was interested in the concept of hacking. 
          The idea of being able to enter someone else's machine and do with it as you please still fascinates me. 
          Of course even more important than the infiltration is the systems defense which is I am specializing in 
          Cybersecurity for my Bachelor's degree.
        </p>
        <p>As far as my interest I enjoy playing video games and watching anime. 
          My favorite video game series is Dishonored but my favorite singular game is Kid Icarus: Uprising.
          My favorite anime is K, yes just the letter, the artstyle and the soundwork combine to make a masterpiece.

        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>

            <p>Created a replica of space invaders from scratch. 
              This project taught me how to take user input for use in controlling on screen behavior,
              animate sprites,use spritesheets, use viewports, and how to make an application take focus.
